Face Recognition

In this project, the performance of pre-trained networks Alexnet and VGG-16 is evaluated on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset. The LFW protocol is a verification protocol. Using the Alexnet and VGG networks, the features are extracted with and without fine-tuning. Any matching algorithm of choice (i.e. Euclidean distance, cosine angle, L1-norm, etc.) is used to produce scores. The ROC curves is to be plotted and the findings are summarized. Note: The images are resized to an appropriate size before being fed into the Alexnet or VGG network.
